The autograder will not accept your submission if it does not include
the project identifier.  Make sure that you grab the Makefile from this
folder, as it includes the project identifier code.

Make sure that all of your source code files, both .cpp and .h
include the project identifier line copied below (do not copy PDF):
    Project Identifier: C0F4DFE8B340D81183C208F70F9D2D797908754D
It is not necessary to include this in your test files.

The two sample tarballs have text files formatted differently for
Mac (and Unix), and a different version for Windows.  If you're on
Windows and transfer your files to CAEN, you should grab the Mac/Unix
version of the files for running on CAEN.

The new data structure that you'll need for Project 3 is the
unordered_map<>.  We'll be talking about how it works the first
lecture back after spring break, but we didn't want you to have
to wait to start on your project until lectures 15-16.  Look up the
online documentation on the unordered_map<>, and also look at the
example file on Canvas / Files / Sample Code / umap_demo.cpp
(taken from the Lecture 15 slides) and wordcount.cpp.
